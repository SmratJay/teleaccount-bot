Telegram Bot Concept and Admin/User Panel Specification🚀
User Panel Buttons
 LFG (Sell Button)✅
Used to sell Telegram account information through the bot.
 Account Details✅
Displays user account information such as sold numbers, withdrawal address,
and other related data.
 Balance✅
Shows total sold accounts, available balance, and related statistics.
 Withdraw✅
- Allows users to request withdrawals.
- Each withdrawal request is sent to a dedicated Telegram channel for leader
review and payment.
- Displays withdrawal summary (currency, TRX address, Binance ID, or USDT-
BEP20).
- Option to delete individual withdrawal history (similar to call-history deletion).
 Language✅
Supports multiple languages. (We’ll use Google Translate to provide multi-
language bot text.)
 System Capacity✅
Displays a global status message — for example, total system activity or capacity
load.
 Status✅
Shows the personal user status (e.g., frozen, active, etc.). Admins can manually
update this status using the user’s Telegram ID and number.
 Support✅
Provides direct contact or messaging with the dev team or bot moderators.
Admin Panel Buttons

Allows admins to broadcast updates or news to all users via bot DM.
 Manual User Data Edit✅
Admins can manually modify any user’s bot data or text shown inside the bot
interface.

deleted after selling an account.

user Status

- Frozen Account Reports (if an account is banned/frozen)
- Spam Account Reports
- Login Code Requests (captures OTP messages and associated phone numbers
to prevent recovery scams)
 Session Management✅
- Automatically terminate all active sessions on other devices (“Log Out All
Devices”).
- Detect multiple-device usage: if the same number is used on two devices, hold
the account for 24–48 hours and force logout from other devices.
 IP / Proxy Configuration✅
Shortcut function to update or rotate IPs daily (to comply with Telegram’s
account safety limits).
 Captcha and Task Verification System✅
Before granting access, users must complete human verification tasks — such as
Captcha, joining Telegram channels/groups, etc.
 Leader Panel (optional but useful)✅
- Manages regional or team leaders.
- Provides access to user withdrawal requests assigned to each leader.
- Tracks leader payment statistics and distribution.
 Log / Activity Tracker✅
Records key actions (sales, withdrawals, IP changes, session terminations, etc.)
for review and security auditing.
