## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Session is NOT in Database
Because you're using **stub implementations**, the session wasn't saved to the database (TelegramAccountService is a stub). 

**BUT** the session file is still saved to disk, which is what matters!

### 2. Session Memory vs Disk
- **Memory cleanup** = Connection closed, RAM cleared
- **Disk storage** = File saved, session persists ✅

### 3. What "Cleanup" Means
```python
# This disconnects the connection:
await client.disconnect()

# This removes from memory:
del active_sessions[session_key]

# But file remains:
# secure_b336237c.session ✅ STILL EXISTS
```

print(f"✅ Still logged in as {me.phone}")
```
