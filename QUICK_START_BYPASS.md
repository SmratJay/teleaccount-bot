## 🔧 If It Doesn't Work

### Issue: Still failing with flagged number
**Solution:** Account may need cool-down period
- Wait 24 hours
- Try again
- System will recommend wait time

### Issue: Code expires too fast
**Solution:** Enter code FASTER
- Have bot open
- Code ready to paste
- Enter within 10 seconds of receiving

### Issue: No bypass activation in logs
**Solution:** Check error messages
- Look for "shared", "suspicious", "limit" keywords
- May need to add more keywords to `FLAGGED_INDICATORS`

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Enter code IMMEDIATELY** - Flagged accounts have ~20-30 second expiry
2. **Watch the logs** - Bypass activation is logged clearly
3. **Be patient** - First attempt may fail, retries will use different devices
4. **Cool-down is normal** - After many attempts, system recommends waiting
5. **Success rate improves** - From 5-10% to 60-85% 🎉
