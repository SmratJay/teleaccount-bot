# âœ… CURRENCY CLARIFICATION

## Your Question: "We are working in USD not rupees"

**ANSWER: You're absolutely right! The bot IS using USD ($).**

The confusion was in my documentation where I mistakenly wrote â‚¹ (rupees symbol). 

## Current Status âœ…

### Bot Code (ALL FILES):
- **Currency:** USD ($)
- **Symbol:** $ 
- **Format:** `${amount:.2f}` (e.g., $988.00)

### Your Account:
```
Balance: $988.00 USD âœ…
(NOT 988 rupees)
```

### Where USD appears:
âœ… All balance displays: `â€¢ ðŸ’° **Balance:** $988.00`
âœ… Earnings: `â€¢ ðŸ’Ž **Total Earnings:** $X.XX`
âœ… Withdrawals: `ðŸ’° Amount: $X.XX`
âœ… Sale prices: `$5-15`, `$15-35`, `$35-100+`
âœ… Payment confirmations: `**ðŸ’° Payment:** $XX.XX added to your balance!`

## NO Changes Needed!

The bot was ALWAYS working in USD. Only my documentation had the wrong symbol.

**Documentation fixed:**
- âœ… CRITICAL_FIXES_OCT19.md now shows: `$988.00 USD`
- âœ… All other files already had $ symbol

## What This Means:
- Your balance of **$988** is in **US Dollars** ðŸ’µ
- All transactions are in **USD**
- Minimum withdrawal: **$10.00 USD**
- Account prices: **$5-100+ USD**

**No code changes were made - everything was already correct!**
