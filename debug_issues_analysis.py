    POSSIBLE CAUSES:
    1. Database connection issue
    2. User not found in database
    3. Missing user creation logic
    4. Exception in balance calculation
    
    INVESTIGATION STEPS:
    - Check if UserService.get_user_by_telegram_id() works
    - Verify database connection in check_balance function
    - Test user creation flow for new users
    - Check balance field initialization
    
    DEBUGGING RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1. Test with /start command first to create user
    2. Check database logs for connection errors
    3. Verify user exists before checking balance
    4. Add more detailed error logging

    2. Click currency (e.g., TRX) → Starts conversation  
    3. Enter wallet address → Should move to confirmation
    4. Confirm withdrawal → Should create withdrawal request
    
    POTENTIAL ISSUES:
    =================
    1. ConversationHandler states not properly defined
    2. handle_withdrawal_details function not responding
    3. Message handlers not catching wallet address input
    4. State transitions failing
    
    CONVERSATION STATES:
    - WITHDRAW_DETAILS: Should handle wallet address input
    - WITHDRAW_CONFIRM: Should handle confirmation

    - handlers/main_handlers.py: withdrawal functions

    POSSIBLE ISSUES:
    1. Import conflicts between main_handlers and real_handlers
    2. ConversationHandler not properly registered
    3. State constants not matching
    4. Message filters not working
