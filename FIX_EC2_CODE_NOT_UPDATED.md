# ❌ EC2 IS RUNNING OLD CODE - Here's How to Fix It

## The Problem

Your logs show ZERO of the new logging messages. This means EC2 never loaded the updated code.

**Missing from your logs:**
- ✅ Withdrawal ConversationHandler registered
- ✅ Selling ConversationHandler registered  
- ✅ Admin handlers registered successfully
- ✅ Reports & Logs handlers loaded
- ✅ System Settings handlers loaded

**What you should see:** These messages appear when the bot starts.

## Why This Happens

Common causes:
1. Git pull didn't actually fetch the new code
2. Systemd service is running from a different directory
3. Service didn't restart properly
4. Python is using cached `.pyc` files

## Fix Steps (Run on EC2)

### Step 1: Verify Current Code
```bash
cd ~/teleaccount-bot
git log -1 --oneline
```

**Expected:** Should show a recent commit about "defensive error handling" or "admin panel fix"

**If it doesn't:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Step 2: Clear Python Cache
```bash
cd ~/teleaccount-bot
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
```

### Step 3: Verify the New Code Exists
```bash
grep "Admin handlers registered successfully" handlers/real_handlers.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
        logger.info("✅ Admin handlers registered successfully")
```

**If nothing appears:** The code wasn't pulled. Do Step 1 again.

### Step 4: Restart Properly
```bash
sudo systemctl stop telebot
sleep 2
sudo systemctl start telebot
```

### Step 5: Watch Startup Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u telebot -f
```

**You MUST see these lines when it starts:**
```
✅ Withdrawal ConversationHandler registered
✅ Selling ConversationHandler registered
✅ Admin handlers registered successfully
Admin handlers set up successfully
```

If you see `⚠️ Failed to load` - that's actually GOOD! It means the new code is running and telling us what's wrong.

### Step 6: If Still Nothing

The service might be running from the wrong directory. Check:
```bash
sudo systemctl status telebot
```

Look for the `WorkingDirectory=` line. It should be `/home/ubuntu/teleaccount-bot`

If it's different, edit the service:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/telebot.service
```

Make sure these lines are correct:
```
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/teleaccount-bot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/teleaccount-bot/real_main.py
```

Then:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart telebot
```

## Quick Diagnostic

Run this ONE command to check everything:
```bash
cd ~/teleaccount-bot && \
echo "=== GIT STATUS ===" && \
git log -1 --oneline && \
echo -e "\n=== CODE CHECK ===" && \
grep -c "Admin handlers registered successfully" handlers/real_handlers.py && \
echo -e "\n=== SERVICE STATUS ===" && \
sudo systemctl status telebot | grep -E "WorkingDirectory|ExecStart|Active:"
```

This will show:
1. Latest commit
2. If new code exists (should show "1")
3. Service configuration

Send me the output and I'll know exactly what's wrong!
