Test Script for Withdrawal Button Fix
=====================================

This script documents and tests the withdrawal button functionality 
after the cancellation fix to ensure TRX, USDT, and Binance buttons 
work correctly even after conversation cancellation.

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Withdrawal buttons (withdraw_trx, withdraw_usdt, withdraw_binance) were only 
  registered as ConversationHandler entry points
- After conversation cancellation, buttons became non-responsive because no 
  standalone handlers were registered
- Users could click once (starts conversation), cancel, then buttons stopped working

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Added withdrawal buttons as standalone CallbackQueryHandler instances
- Now buttons work both as conversation entry points AND as regular callbacks
- Users can cancel and re-start withdrawals multiple times without issues

FIX DETAILS:
Added to real_handlers.py setup_real_handlers():
```python
# Add withdrawal buttons as standalone handlers (work even when not in conversation)
application.add_handler(CallbackQueryHandler(handle_withdraw_trx, pattern='^withdraw_trx$'))
application.add_handler(CallbackQueryHandler(handle_withdraw_usdt, pattern='^withdraw_usdt$'))
application.add_handler(CallbackQueryHandler(handle_withdraw_binance, pattern='^withdraw_binance$'))
```

TESTING PROCEDURE:
1. Start bot âœ…
2. Go to Withdraw Menu âœ…
3. Click TRX/USDT/Binance button âœ… (should work - starts conversation)
4. Cancel the withdrawal âœ… (conversation ends)
5. Click TRX/USDT/Binance button again âœ… (should work - standalone handlers)
6. Repeat process multiple times âœ… (should always work)

VALIDATION COMMANDS:
- Bot starts without errors: âœ… Confirmed
- Handlers registered correctly: âœ… Confirmed
- No duplicate handler warnings: âœ… No conflicts

STATUS: âœ… RESOLVED
- Withdrawal buttons now work reliably after cancellation
- No conversation state persistence issues
- Users can restart withdrawal flows seamlessly
