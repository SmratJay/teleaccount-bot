# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be added to the global gitignore or merged into this project gitignore.  For a PyCharm
#  project, it is recommended to use the following settings:
#
#  Editor | File and Code Templates | Python Script
#  and add the following to the top of the file:
#
#  #!/usr/bin/env python3
#  """Template for new Python files."""
#
#  Remember to change the file extension from .txt to .py if you're creating a Python file.
