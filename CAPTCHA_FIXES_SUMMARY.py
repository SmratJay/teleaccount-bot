CAPTCHA SYSTEM FIXES - VISUAL ONLY IMPLEMENTATION

âœ… COMPLETED FIXES:

1. **Removed Text-Based Captchas**: 
   - Eliminated math questions (15 + 27 = ?, 8 Ã— 7 = ?, etc.)
   - Removed text challenges ("Type TELEGRAM", "What comes after A,B,C?", etc.)
   - Only visual image captchas are now generated

2. **Updated CaptchaService**:
   - Modified generate_captcha() to only call generate_visual_captcha()
   - Removed math_questions and text_questions arrays
   - All fallback logic now generates visual captchas only

3. **Simplified Handler Logic**:
   - Removed conditional text for different captcha types
   - Only shows visual captcha instructions
   - Consistent user experience with image-based verification

4. **Updated Localization**:
   - Changed "captcha_question" to "captcha_instruction" in all languages
   - Removed text-based captcha references from English, Spanish, and Russian
   - Focused messaging on visual image verification

5. **Verified Implementation**:
   - Test script confirms only visual captchas are generated
   - All 5 test generations produced visual type with images
   - No more conflicting text questions in prompts

ðŸŽ¯ RESULT: 
The bot now exclusively uses visual image captchas. Users will see a generated image with 
5 random characters (letters + numbers) and must type exactly what they see. This eliminates 
any confusion from mixed captcha types and provides a consistent verification experience.

ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- services/captcha.py: Streamlined to visual-only generation
- handlers/main_handlers.py: Simplified captcha display logic  
- locales/messages.json: Updated messaging for all languages
- Removed math/text question arrays and logic

âœ… Status: COMPLETE - Ready for testing
