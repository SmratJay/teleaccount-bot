# 🚨 IMPORTANT: USE THIS BOT FILE INSTEAD!

## ❌ **DON'T USE `real_main.py` YET**

The `real_main.py` file requires User and Account models that aren't built yet.

---

## ✅ **USE THIS INSTEAD: `bot_proxy_test.py`**

This is your **working bot** with all proxy features!

   ```

2. **Open Telegram** and find your bot

---

## 🔧 **WHY `real_main.py` DOESN'T WORK:**

The `real_main.py` file tries to import these services:
- ❌ `UserService` - Not built yet
- ❌ `TelegramAccountService` - Not built yet
- ❌ `SystemSettingsService` - Not built yet
- ❌ `WithdrawalService` - Not built yet
- ❌ `ActivityLogService` - Not built yet

**These are for the account selling features which aren't implemented yet.**

---

## ✅ **WHAT YOU HAVE NOW:**

### Working (`bot_proxy_test.py`):
- ✅ Complete proxy system
- ✅ WebShare integration
- ✅ 8 functional commands
- ✅ Auto-refresh
- ✅ Load balancing
- ✅ Health monitoring

### Not Working Yet (`real_main.py`):
- ❌ Account selling features
- ❌ User management
- ❌ Payment processing
- ❌ Withdrawal system

---

## 🚀 **QUICK START:**

```powershell
# Stop any running bot (Ctrl+C)

# Start the working bot
D:/teleaccount_bot/.venv/Scripts/python.exe bot_proxy_test.py

# Wait for "✅ Bot started successfully!"

# Test in Telegram:
# Send: /webshare_info
# Send: /fetch_webshare
# Send: /proxy_stats
```

---

## 💡 **FOR THE FUTURE:**

If you need the account selling features from `real_main.py`, we'll need to build:

1. **User Model** - Store user data
2. **TelegramAccount Model** - Store account info
3. **UserService** - User operations
4. **TelegramAccountService** - Account operations
5. **Payment System** - Handle transactions
6. **Withdrawal System** - Process withdrawals

**But for now, use `bot_proxy_test.py` - it has everything you need for proxy management!**

---

## ✅ **BOTTOM LINE:**

**Use this command:**
```powershell
D:/teleaccount_bot/.venv/Scripts/python.exe bot_proxy_test.py
```

**NOT this:**
```powershell
D:/teleaccount_bot/.venv/Scripts/python.exe real_main.py  ❌
```

**Your bot is ready to test! Start `bot_proxy_test.py` now!** 🚀
