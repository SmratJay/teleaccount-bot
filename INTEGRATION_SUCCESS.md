## ⚠️ Warnings (Non-Critical)

### PTB Warnings - INFORMATIONAL ONLY
```
PTBUserWarning: If 'per_message=False', 'CallbackQueryHandler' will not be tracked for every message.
```

**Impact**: None - This is expected behavior  
**Reason**: ConversationHandlers use `per_message=False` by design  
**Action**: No action needed (informational warning)

**Locations**:
- handlers/real_handlers.py:3189 (withdrawal conversation)
- handlers/real_handlers.py:2677 (selling conversation)
- handlers/admin_handlers.py:2167 (broadcast conversation)
- handlers/admin_handlers.py:2191 (user edit conversation)

### SSL Warning - INFORMATIONAL ONLY
```
INFO - Failed to load SSL library: <class 'OSError'> (no library called "ssl" found)
INFO - cryptg module not installed and libssl not found, falling back to (slower) Python encryption
```

**Impact**: Slightly slower encryption (not noticeable)  
**Reason**: Optional optimization library not installed  
**Action**: Optional - can install `cryptg` for faster encryption
