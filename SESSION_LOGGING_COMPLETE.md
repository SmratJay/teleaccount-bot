### ✅ 2. Session File Auto-Send to Group
**Feature:** Physical .session file sent as document

After logging the sale, the bot automatically:
- ✅ Sends the `.session` file as a Telegram document
- ✅ Attaches it to the notification group topic
- ✅ Includes caption with buyer details and price
- ✅ Names file as `{phone}_{session_file}` for easy identification

**Document Caption:**
```
