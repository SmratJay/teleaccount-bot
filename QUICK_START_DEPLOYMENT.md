# üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE - Account Freeze & Sale Management System

## ‚úÖ System Status: COMPLETE & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## üì¶ What Was Built

A complete account management system with:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic account freezing** on multi-device detection (24-48 hour holds)
- ‚úÖ **Manual freeze/unfreeze** controls in admin panel
- ‚úÖ **Sale approval system** that blocks frozen accounts
- ‚úÖ **User notifications** for all freeze/unfreeze events
- ‚úÖ **Scheduled background job** to auto-release expired freezes
- ‚úÖ **UI indicators** (‚ùÑÔ∏è emoji) throughout the bot
- ‚úÖ **Complete activity logging** for audit trail

---

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Multi-Device Detection
When a user's Telegram account is active on 2+ devices:
- System automatically freezes account for 24 hours
- User receives notification explaining the freeze
- Account cannot be sold during freeze period
- After 24 hours, automatic unfreeze

### 2. Sale Approval Blocking
When admin tries to approve a sale:
- System checks if account is frozen
- If frozen: **BLOCKS approval** with clear error message
- Admin must unfreeze account first before approving
- Prevents accidental approval of compromised accounts

### 3. Admin Controls
New admin panel buttons:
- **‚ùÑÔ∏è Account Freeze Management** - View and manage frozen accounts
- **üìã Sale Logs & Approval** - Review and approve/reject sales

### 4. User Protection
When user tries to sell a frozen account:
- System blocks at phone number entry stage
- Shows freeze reason and duration
- Prevents wasting time with OTP process
- Clear instructions on what to do next

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Database
```bash
# PostgreSQL
pg_dump your_database > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# SQLite
cp teleaccount_bot.db teleaccount_bot_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration
```bash
cd d:\teleaccount_bot
python database\migrations\migrate_account_freeze.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```

## üß™ Testing the System

### Test 1: Multi-Device Auto-Freeze (Manual Simulation)
```python
# In Python console or test script:
from database import get_db_session, close_db_session
from services.account_management import account_manager

db = get_db_session()
try:
    # Freeze a test account
    result = account_manager.freeze_account(
        db=db,
        account_id=1,  # Replace with real account ID
        reason="Multi-device usage detected",
        admin_id=1,  # System admin
        duration_hours=24
    )
    print("Freeze result:", result)
finally:
    close_db_session(db)
```

### Test 2: Blocked Sale Attempt
1. As regular user, click "Sell New Account"
2. Enter phone number of frozen account
3. **Expected:** Error message with freeze reason
4. **Should NOT proceed to OTP stage**

### Test 3: Admin Sale Approval Block
1. As admin, go to "üìã Sale Logs & Approval"
2. Find a sale for frozen account (has ‚ùÑÔ∏è indicator)
3. Try to approve it
4. **Expected:** "‚ùÑÔ∏è APPROVAL BLOCKED - ACCOUNT FROZEN" error
5. **Sale stays PENDING**

### Test 4: Manual Unfreeze
1. As admin, go to "‚ùÑÔ∏è Account Freeze Management"
2. Click "View Frozen Accounts"
3. Click "üî• Unfreeze" on an account
4. **Expected:** Success message
5. Verify account can now be sold

### Test 5: Scheduled Job (Wait 1 Hour)
1. Freeze an account with 1-hour duration
2. Wait 1 hour
3. Check logs for: "Auto-released X expired frozen accounts"
4. Verify account is unfrozen automatically
5. User should receive notification

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (No Changes Required)
The system uses existing environment variables:
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot token
- `API_ID` - Telegram API ID
- `API_HASH` - Telegram API hash
- Database connection (existing)

### Default Settings
```python
# Multi-device freeze duration
DEFAULT_FREEZE_HOURS = 24

# Scheduled job interval
FREEZE_CHECK_INTERVAL = 3600  # 1 hour

# First job run delay
FIRST_JOB_DELAY = 10  # 10 seconds after startup
```

These can be customized in:
- `services/session_management.py` (line ~50)
- `real_main.py` (line ~90)

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### Key Log Messages to Monitor

**Successful Freeze:**
```
INFO - Account 123 (+1234567890) frozen by admin 1
INFO - Activity logged: ACCOUNT_FROZEN
```

**Blocked Sale:**
```
WARNING - Cannot approve sale 456: account is frozen
INFO - Sale approval blocked for frozen account +1234567890
```

**Auto-Unfreeze:**
```
INFO - Auto-released 3 expired frozen accounts
INFO - Account 123 (+1234567890) unfrozen by admin 1
```

**Scheduled Job:**
```
INFO - Scheduled hourly freeze expiry check job
INFO - Running freeze expiry check...
```

### Database Activity Log
Check `activity_logs` table for:
- Action type: `ACCOUNT_FROZEN`
- Action type: `ACCOUNT_UNFROZEN`
- Extra data contains full context (JSON)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Migration Fails
**Error:** "Column already exists"
**Solution:** Run verification only:
```python
python database/migrations/migrate_account_freeze.py verify
```

### Issue 2: Notifications Not Sent
**Check:**
1. Is notification service initialized? (Check logs for "Notification service initialized")
2. Does user have valid `telegram_user_id`?
3. Is bot blocked by user?

**Debug:**
```python
from utils.notification_service import get_notification_service
ns = get_notification_service()
if ns:
    print("‚úÖ Notification service ready")
else:
    print("‚ùå Not initialized")
```

### Issue 3: Scheduled Job Not Running
**Check logs for:**
```
INFO - Scheduled hourly freeze expiry check job
```

**If missing:**
1. Check `real_main.py` line ~90
2. Verify `application.job_queue` is not None
3. Ensure no exceptions during startup

**Manual trigger:**
```python
from services.account_management import account_manager
from database import get_db_session, close_db_session

db = get_db_session()
try:
    result = account_manager.check_and_release_expired_freezes(db)
    print(f"Released: {result['released_count']}")
finally:
    close_db_session(db)
```

### Issue 4: Admin Buttons Not Showing
**Check:**
1. Is user actually admin? (Check `is_admin()` function)
2. Are handlers registered? (Check `setup_admin_handlers` in logs)
3. Try `/start` to refresh menu

**Verify handlers:**
```python
python -c "from handlers.admin_handlers import setup_admin_handlers; print('‚úÖ Handlers OK')"
```

### Issue 5: Frozen Account Still Sellable
**Check:**
1. Is `can_be_sold` flag set to False?
2. Is freeze check in `handle_real_phone` function?
3. Check database: `SELECT is_frozen, can_be_sold FROM telegram_accounts WHERE id = X`

**Manual fix:**
```sql
UPDATE telegram_accounts 
SET can_be_sold = FALSE 
WHERE is_frozen = TRUE;
```

## üéì User Guide (For Admins)

### Daily Admin Tasks

#### Morning Routine:
1. Check "üìã Sale Logs & Approval"
2. Review pending sales (focus on üü¢ active ones)
3. Approve valid sales
4. Reject suspicious ones with reason

#### If Account Flagged:
1. Go to "‚ùÑÔ∏è Account Freeze Management"
2. Review frozen accounts list
3. Check freeze reason
4. Decide: Keep frozen OR unfreeze
5. If unfreezing, add notes explaining why

#### Weekly Review:
1. Check "Freeze History" (if built)
2. Look for patterns (same users frozen repeatedly?)
3. Adjust freeze durations if needed
4. Review rejection reasons for sales

### Common Admin Scenarios

**Scenario: User Complains Can't Sell**
1. Ask for phone number
2. Check "‚ùÑÔ∏è Account Freeze Management"
3. Search for their account
4. If frozen: Explain reason to user
5. If legitimate: Unfreeze with notes
6. If suspicious: Keep frozen, explain policy

**Scenario: Sale Shows ‚ùÑÔ∏è Icon**
1. DO NOT approve immediately
2. Check freeze reason
3. Investigate: Why was it frozen?
4. Options:
   - Multi-device? ‚Üí May be legitimate, review duration
   - Suspicious activity? ‚Üí Keep frozen, reject sale
   - Manual hold? ‚Üí Contact who froze it

**Scenario: Mass Freezes (Attack Detection)**
1. Check activity logs
2. Identify pattern (same IP? same time?)
3. Freeze all related accounts
4. Investigate before unfreezing
5. Consider permanent bans if confirmed attack

## üéâ Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- ‚úÖ Number of multi-device detections per day
