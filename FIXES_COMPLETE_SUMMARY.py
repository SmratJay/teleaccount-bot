    ✅ BUTTON LAYOUT - FIXED TO MATCH SCREENSHOT EXACTLY
    
    IMPLEMENTED CHANGES:
    ====================
    
    OLD LAYOUT (2x4 grid):
    [LFG]         [Account Details]
    [Balance]     [Withdraw] 
    [Language]    [System Capacity]
    [Status]      [Support]
    
    NEW LAYOUT (Client Requirements):
    [🚀 LFG (Sell)]                     <- Full width top
    [📋 Account Details] [💸 Withdraw]   <- Row 2
    [📊 System Capacity] [🌍 Language]   <- Row 3  
    [💰 Balance]         [📈 Status]     <- Row 4
    [🆘 Support]                         <- Full width bottom
    
    IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Created keyboard_layout_fix.py with get_main_menu_keyboard() function
    - Imported into real_handlers.py 
    - Replaced InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard) with get_main_menu_keyboard()
    - Matches client screenshot exactly
    
    ✅ STATUS: LAYOUT FIXED AND IMPLEMENTED

    🔧 WITHDRAWAL PROCESS - DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTED
    
    PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
    ===================
    - User clicks withdrawal button → Gets currency options ✅
    - User clicks TRX/USDT/Binance → Shows wallet form ✅  
    - User enters wallet address → NO RESPONSE ❌
    - Bot should show confirmation but doesn't respond ❌
    
    DEBUG FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
    ========================
    1. Added debug_withdrawal_text_handler with extensive logging
    2. Wrapped handle_withdrawal_details with try/catch and logging
    3. Added user_data and chat_data logging to track conversation state
    4. Enhanced error reporting to show exact error messages
    
    DEBUGGING FEATURES ADDED:
    - Logger shows when text is received: "User {id} sent text: '{text}'"
    - Shows conversation context: user_data and chat_data
    - Catches and reports any exceptions in handle_withdrawal_details
    - Shows handler return values for state tracking
    
    CONVERSATION HANDLER SETUP:
    - Entry points: handle_withdraw_trx, handle_withdraw_usdt, handle_withdraw_binance ✅
    - States: WITHDRAW_DETAILS → debug_withdrawal_text_handler ✅
    - Fallbacks: cancel_withdrawal for menu navigation ✅
    - Registration: withdrawal_conversation added to application ✅

    📋 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLIENT
    
    BUTTON LAYOUT TEST:
    ===================
    1. Send /start to bot
    2. Check if layout matches screenshot:
       - Top: [🚀 LFG (Sell)] full width
       - Row 2: [📋 Account Details] [💸 Withdraw]
       - Row 3: [📊 System Capacity] [🌍 Language] 
       - Row 4: [💰 Balance] [📈 Status]
       - Bottom: [🆘 Support] full width
    
    ✅ Expected Result: Layout matches client requirements exactly
    
    WITHDRAWAL PROCESS TEST:
    ========================
    1. Click "💸 Withdraw" button
    2. Click "🟡 Withdraw TRX" (or USDT/Binance)  
    3. Type wallet address in chat: "TRxxx...xxx"
    4. Check terminal logs for debug messages
    5. Bot should respond with confirmation or error details
    
    DEBUG LOG MONITORING:
    =====================
    Watch terminal for these debug messages:
    - "🔍 WITHDRAWAL DEBUG - User {id} sent text: '{address}'"
    - "🔍 WITHDRAWAL DEBUG - User data: {...}"
    - "🔍 WITHDRAWAL DEBUG - Handler returned: {result}"
    - Any error messages will show exact problem
    
    ✅ Expected Result: Bot responds to wallet address input

    🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
    
    IF BUTTON LAYOUT DOESN'T MATCH:
    ================================
    - Check if keyboard_layout_fix.py is being imported properly
    - Verify get_main_menu_keyboard() function is called
    - Restart bot if layout changes don't appear
    
    IF WITHDRAWAL STILL NOT RESPONDING:
    ===================================
    1. Check terminal logs for "🔍 WITHDRAWAL DEBUG" messages
    2. If no debug messages appear → MessageHandler not catching text
    3. If debug messages show errors → Check handle_withdrawal_details function
    4. If "Handler returned: END" → Conversation ending prematurely
    
    COMMON SOLUTIONS:
    =================
    1. Ensure user has balance > $0 (TRX handler checks balance first)
    2. Send /start command first to create user in database  
    3. Check database connection for balance loading errors
    4. Verify handle_withdrawal_details is imported from main_handlers
    
    IMMEDIATE DEBUG STEPS:
    ======================
    1. Click withdraw → TRX → type "test123" in chat
    2. Check terminal for debug logs
    3. If logs appear but error occurs → function import issue
    4. If no logs appear → MessageHandler registration issue
