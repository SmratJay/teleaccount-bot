## 🧪 ADVANCED TESTING

### Test Operation-Based Selection
The proxy system assigns proxies based on operation importance:

**Critical Operations (Get Best Proxies):**
- `ACCOUNT_CREATION` - Reputation ≥ 4.0, Success ≥ 90%
- `OTP_RETRIEVAL` - Reputation ≥ 3.5, Success ≥ 85%
- `VERIFICATION` - Reputation ≥ 4.0, Success ≥ 90%

**Normal Operations:**
- `LOGIN` - Reputation ≥ 3.0, Success ≥ 80%
- `MESSAGE_SEND` - Reputation ≥ 2.5, Success ≥ 75%

**Low Priority:**
- `TESTING` - Any proxy
- `GENERAL` - Any proxy

### Test Country Matching
The system extracts country codes from phone numbers:
- `+1` → US proxies
- `+44` → GB proxies
- `+33` → FR proxies
- `+49` → DE proxies
- `+351` → PT proxies
- `+7` → RU proxies

### Test Load Balancing Strategies

1. **Round Robin** - Distributes evenly
2. **Weighted** - Favors better proxies (default)
3. **Reputation-Based** - Uses highest reputation
4. **Least Used** - Balances usage counts
5. **Random** - Random selection
6. **Fastest** - Uses fastest response times

## 📱 TELEGRAM BOT TERMINAL OUTPUT

Your bot is currently running and showing:
```
✅ Bot started successfully!
Press Ctrl+C to stop

[Logs show successful connection to Telegram API]
[Proxy manager loaded 8 operation types]
[All systems operational]
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Bot Not Responding?
1. Check if process is still running (look at terminal)
2. Verify bot token in `.env` is correct
3. Check internet connection
4. Look for errors in terminal output

### Commands Not Working?
1. Make sure you're using the correct bot
2. Send `/start` first to initialize
3. Check if commands have typos
4. Look for error messages in bot responses

### No Proxies Showing?
1. Run integration test: `python tests/test_integration_full.py`
2. Check database: Should have 500 proxies
3. Verify database connection in terminal logs
4. Check if proxies are marked as active

### Terminal Shows Errors?
1. Note the error message
2. Check if it's just formatting (not critical)
3. Look for "ERROR" vs "INFO" log levels
4. Bot may still work despite minor errors

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### After Testing Basic Commands

1. **Add WebShare Token** (Optional)
   - Get token from https://proxy.webshare.io/userapi/
   - Add to `.env`: `WEBSHARE_API_TOKEN=your_token`
   - Set `WEBSHARE_ENABLED=true`
   - Restart bot
   - Run `/fetch_webshare` command (need to add handler)

2. **Enable Auto-Refresh** (Optional)
   - Edit `.env`: `PROXY_AUTO_REFRESH=true`
   - Set refresh interval: `PROXY_REFRESH_INTERVAL=86400` (24h)
   - Restart bot
   - Proxies will refresh automatically

3. **Test with Real Accounts** (Optional)
   - Requires building User/Account models
   - Test full account creation workflow
   - Test OTP retrieval with real phone
   - Test session management

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - Use full `real_main.py` with all handlers
   - Configure database properly
   - Set up monitoring
   - Use process manager (PM2, systemd)

## 💡 TIPS

### Performance Testing
- Run `/proxy_test` multiple times to see load balancing
- Switch strategies and compare results
- Monitor which proxies get selected most often

### Strategy Comparison
- Try `weighted` for production (best overall)
- Try `reputation_based` for critical operations
- Try `least_used` for even distribution
- Try `fastest` for speed optimization

### Monitoring
- Check `/proxy_health` regularly
- Watch for decreasing success rates
- Note which providers have best performance
- Track operation counts over time
