---

## ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### Phase 1: Database Layer - 100% Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Multiple stub implementations causing warnings  
**Solution**: Replaced ALL stubs with real SQLAlchemy operations

**Services Implemented**:
1. ✅ **UserService** (5 functions)
   - get_or_create_user, get_user_by_telegram_id, update_user, update_balance, get_user

2. ✅ **WithdrawalService** (5 functions)
   - create_withdrawal, get_user_withdrawals, get_withdrawal, update_withdrawal_status, get_pending_withdrawals

3. ✅ **ActivityLogService** (4 functions)
   - log_activity, log_action, get_user_activity, get_all_activity

4. ✅ **VerificationService** (3 functions)
   - create_verification, get_user_verifications, update_verification_status

5. ✅ **TelegramAccountService** (already implemented)
   - All account management functions

**Result**: **ZERO** stub warnings in codebase ✅
